# Next14 Edge Redirect

This example demonstrates how to use Vercel's Edge functionality to easily redirect all incoming traffic from a domain to a different URL of your choice.

### Customizing the Redirect

To customize the redirection destination, modify the middleware.ts file. By default, it redirects all traffic to "https://linktr.ee/austinai". You can change the destination URL by editing this file.

Please note that this is a simple app designed for domain redirection. The only file you need to modify is middleware.ts to specify the target URL you want to redirect to.
